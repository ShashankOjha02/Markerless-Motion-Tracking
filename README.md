## Student Research Intern 
Marker-less motion capture (MOCAP) is a technology that utilizes high-definition cameras to analyze human motion, primarily focusing on gait patterns. As marker-less motion capture starts to become a more prominent technology to measure gait, it is necessary to understand the limitations, consistency, and abilities of the technology.  The following study uses marker-less MOCAP with the software Theia3D (Theia Markerless Inc., Kingston, ON) to observe gait kinematics. Theia3D uses 2D images from video cameras to track the kinematics of a subject by predicting the placement of virtual markers on the subject’s body. This technology is like marker-based motion tracking, however limitations such as placing 51 physical markers on the subject is not required. 
One of the questions that need to be answered about MOCAP is how camera angle and positioning affects the consistency of the technology. By seeing how camera positioning affects accuracy, the data can be used to inform future markerless collectors of locations with the most promising results. The following experiment was designed to see exactly how camera positioning and angles affects the accuracy of MOCAP. By accessing multiple subjects’ movements in various directions, it can be checked if there are large discrepancies in any of the directions, thus evaluating its consistency.
